### MVP

The MVP for Survey Orangutan was an application that would allow a signed up memeber to take and create surveys. The author of the survey will also have access to the responses of the survey answered by users.

### Trello Board & Wireframe

Our [Trello][] board with images of the wireframes.

### Team Dynamic and Git workflow

The Git [Workflow][] was simple: each member would take on a task via [Trello][] and when it is completed, move it to the 'Completed' section. The Git master would review the pushed task and merge it if it was in line with the task. 

In addition to Trello, team Survey Orangutan used [Slack][] as the main form of communication throughout the project. This allowed the team to be in constant communication with each other when working remotely. Every member contributed to the project and worked great together by consistantly communicating the status of the project with each other. The team leaned on each other for helped and guidence which contributed to the sucess fo the project.
